## ☀️ Beacon Chain Integration

All Lighthouse operations and metadata are publicly verifiable and anchored.

- [`launch-lighthouse.sh`](./beacon/launch-lighthouse.sh) – Sync from checkpoint
- [`lighthouse.service`](./beacon/lighthouse.service) – systemd persistence unit
- [`beacon-authorship-proof.txt`](./beacon/beacon-authorship-proof.txt) – Signed boot log
- [`beacon-release.json`](./beacon/beacon-release.json) – Machine-verifiable metadata
