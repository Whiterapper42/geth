# Launching Geth & Lighthouse

This repository contains configurations and setup scripts for running an Ethereum consensus client (Lighthouse) and execution client (Geth). It supports syncing from genesis, validator management, and full node deployment.

## Features
- Geth execution client setup
- Lighthouse beacon chain node configuration
- Validator key management (optional)
- Systemd service files (Linux)
- Instructions for syncing and monitoring

## Requirements
- Ubuntu 22.04+
- Geth (vX.X.X)
- Lighthouse (vX.X.X)
- 4+ CPUs, 16GB+ RAM, SSD recommended

## Setup
Instructions coming soon...
# Notarization Tools

This toolkit notarizes the Geth binary with verifiable metadata, GPG verification, and decentralized anchoring via IPFS and OpenTimestamps.

## Features
- GPG signature validation
- SHA256 checksum
- Author declaration linkage
- Smart contract binding for on-chain proof
- IPFS and OpenTimestamps anchoring

## Usage
```bash
bash notarization-tools/notarize.sh
## üîç Public Release Ledger

- [CHANGELOG.md](./changelog.md) ‚Äì Human-readable release history
- [release.json](./release.json) ‚Äì Machine-readable metadata: hashes, CIDs, declarations
- [SHA256SUMS](./SHA256SUMS) + [Signature](./SHA256SUMS.asc) ‚Äì Integrity + provenance
bash notarization-tools/notarize.sh

That final triple backtick (` ``` `) ensures syntax highlighting ends cleanly before the next section.

---

### ‚ú® Suggestion: Move the Badges to the Top

Putting your Shields.io badges directly beneath the repo title (`# geth`) immediately signals trustworthiness. For example:

```markdown
# geth

[![Notarized](https://img.shields.io/badge/notarized-‚úì-brightgreen)](./authorship-proof.txt)
[![Validator Linked](https://img.shields.io/badge/validator--identity-signed-blue)](./validator-identity/)
[![release.json](https://img.shields.io/badge/metadata-complete-yellow)](./release.json)
## Usage
```bash
bash notarization-tools/notarize.sh
```
## Usage
```bash
bash notarization-tools/notarize.sh

That triple backtick ends the syntax block cleanly and restores markdown rendering for the rest.

---

### üßº Suggestion: Move the `üîç Public Release Ledger` Section  
Right now, it‚Äôs stuck inside the code block. Once the backtick is fixed, it‚Äôll appear properly below the **Usage** header. For clarity, you might even give it its own heading:

```markdown
## üîç Public Release Ledger

- [CHANGELOG.md](./changelog.md) ‚Äì Human-readable release history  
- [release.json](./release.json) ‚Äì Machine-readable metadata: hashes, CIDs, declarations  
- [SHA256SUMS](./SHA256SUMS) + [Signature](./SHA256SUMS.asc) ‚Äì Integrity + provenance  

That triple backtick ends the syntax block cleanly and restores markdown rendering for the rest.

             [Validator Identity] ‚Äî GPG ‚ûù Declaration ‚ûù IPFS ‚ûù Beacon Deposit
## Usage
```bash
bash notarization-tools/notarize.sh

That closes the lingering code block so everything afterward renders as intended.

### ‚úÖ 2. Move the Public Release Ledger Out of the Code Block

It‚Äôs currently stuck inside the bash block. After closing it (above), paste this separately:

```markdown

- [release.json](./release.json) ‚Äì Machine-readable metadata: hashes, CIDs, declarations

This markdown renders cleanly and conveys exactly how proof, metadata, and validator identity travel across tools and ledgers.

- ‚úÖ Timestamped via OpenTimestamps (if available)
- ‚úÖ Anchored to IPFS (optional)
- ‚úÖ Linked in `beacon-release.json`
